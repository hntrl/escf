# Plan to Achieve Feature Completeness

Based on the conceptual questions and answers documented in docs/3-conceptual-questions.md, here's an outline of next steps and major milestones needed to bring this library to feature completeness.

---

## 1. Aggregate Enhancements

1. **Snapshot & Rehydration Functionality**

   - Implement snapshotting for aggregates to mitigate performance issues in high-volume or long-lived aggregates.
   - Provide a mechanism to rebuild aggregate state from snapshots (and possibly partial event histories) to recover from unexpected states or data corruption.
   - Ensure backward compatibility with older snapshots while matching the current event schemas.

2. **Stronger Concurrency & Invariant Safeguards**
   - Explore options to allow stronger cross-aggregate invariants within the constraints of the Durable Objects model (e.g., extending or bridging multiple aggregates during command execution).
   - Provide clear documentation on concurrency boundaries, explaining how Durable Objects handle concurrency at the single-aggregate level and how to design around multi-aggregate invariants.

---

## 2. Event Store Improvements

1. **Versioning & Event Lenses**

   - Formalize event schema versioning.
   - Introduce an "event lens" pipeline for evolving event definitions, ensuring they can be updated with minimal friction.
   - Provide performance guidelines for frequent schema changes to avoid large overhead in repeated transformations.

2. **Archive & Retention Configuration**
   - Offer a default basic retention policy (e.g., time-based or storage-based).
   - Document how to configure a custom archive flow to cold storage for older events, especially relevant for D1’s 10GB limit.
   - Outline advanced retention strategies (e.g., snapshot-based pruning).

---

## 3. Projections & Read Models

1. **Projection Lifecycle & Rebuild**

   - Define standardized interfaces or utilities for partial or full projection rebuilds from the event store.
   - Document best practices for adopting new event schemas without breaking existing projections.

2. **Incremental / Partial Updates**

   - Evaluate whether partial or partial-on-demand projection updates will be beneficial.
   - Provide recommended patterns or scaffolding to implement partial updates (e.g., chunked event replays).

3. **Stateful Projections (Optional)**
   - Offer optional support for persistent projection state (e.g., storing last processed event ID), especially for large or highly dynamic read models.
   - Explore integration with KV or D1 for snapshotting projection state.

---

## 4. Reactive Architecture & Pub/Sub

1. **Integration with External Queues**

   - Add an optional interface to handle asynchronous event dispatch (Pub/Sub or message queue).
   - Explore Cloudflare Queues or other systems for scaling message throughput and decoupling.

2. **Backpressure & Throttling**
   - Provide a simple mechanism to configure or plug in backpressure strategies for high event throughput.
   - Investigate internal flow control to prevent event consumers from being overwhelmed by bursts of events.

---

## 5. CQRS & Command Handling

1. **Centralized Command Execution Interface**

   - Introduce a standardized API to submit commands, handle schema validation, and route them to the appropriate aggregate.
   - Explore new patterns (e.g., command bus) for advanced use cases, while preserving a lightweight path for simpler scenarios.

2. **Idempotency Tokens**
   - Implement optional idempotency tokens for commands to protect against accidental re-submission.
   - Document strategies for deduplicating replayed commands in distributed or retry scenarios.

---

## 6. Testing & Tooling

1. **Local Dev & Virtual Cloud Worker Testing**

   - Provide Miniflare or local Cloudflare Worker stubs for integration testing.
   - Include examples of concurrency and event ordering tests.

2. **Test Data Management**
   - Document best practices for seeding event data, cleaning up test data, and verifying read models.
   - Provide a reference testing utility for small end-to-end scenarios.

---

## 7. Operational & Deployment Best Practices

1. **Zero-Downtime Deployments**

   - Create guidelines for safely evolving command/event schemas in production.
   - Suggest patterns such as “dark launching” new versions of Worker scripts alongside old versions.

2. **Logging & Monitoring**

   - Offer a consistent logging format that integrates well with Cloudflare’s Worker environment.
   - Outline recommended approaches for instrumentation, metrics, and alerting.

3. **Multi-Region & Geo-Replication**

   - Detail how Cloudflare’s global edges function under the hood, clarifying that durable data is pinned to a single region, and highlight how that affects failover or replication scenarios.

4. **Security & Compliance**
   - Provide practical examples to incorporate encryption-at-rest or at the application level.
   - Document a strategy for redacting or masking PII or other sensitive event data.

---

## 8. Documentation & User Experience

1. **End-to-End Tutorials**

   - Write example guides for building a simple domain using aggregates, commands, events, and projections.
   - Include a reference architecture diagram for how all library components fit together.

2. **API Reference**
   - Ensure all key interfaces (e.g., event store, aggregate definition, system builder) are fully documented.
   - Provide comments in code and relevant TypeScript declarations for easier developer navigation.

---

## 9. Timeline & Priorities

1. **Phase 1: Core Stability & Snapshotting**

   - Aggregate snapshot support and minimal retention policy.
   - Basic docs for concurrency, versioning, and partial event replays.

2. **Phase 2: Extended Features**

   - Optional external queue integration, custom pub/sub, and advanced projection APIs.
   - Tools for building partial read models or on-demand projection updates.

3. **Phase 3: Operational & UX**

   - Detailed deployment guidelines, advanced testing utilities, logging, and analytics patterns.
   - Extended documentation, tutorials, reference implementations, recommended best practices.

4. **Phase 4: Hardening & Polishing**
   - More robust error-handling, backpressure, and multi-tenant or multi-context expansions.
   - Security and compliance tooling, performance optimizations, and final documentation refinements.

---

## 10. Ongoing Extensions

- Persistent developer feedback loops for additional event store backends.
- Support for future Cloudflare features (e.g., updated Durable Objects or new queue services).
- Integration with broader ecosystem (e.g., analytics pipelines, third-party monitoring tools).

This plan prioritizes ease of understanding and quick wins early on, with deeper and more complex features to follow once the core system is stable.
